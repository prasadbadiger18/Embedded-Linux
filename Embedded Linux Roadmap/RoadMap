Embedded Linux refers to the use of the Linux operating system in embedded systems—these are specialized computing systems that are dedicated to specific tasks or applications, typically with real-time performance, power, and size constraints. Embedded Linux is often used in devices like routers, smart TVs, automotive infotainment systems, industrial controllers, and more.

Key features of Embedded Linux include:

Customization: Embedded Linux can be heavily customized to fit the specific needs of the hardware and application, reducing unnecessary components to optimize for performance, size, and power consumption.

Small Footprint: Unlike general-purpose Linux distributions for PCs, embedded Linux versions are tailored to be lightweight and efficient to work within the resource constraints of embedded systems.

Real-Time Capabilities: Some embedded systems require real-time capabilities. While standard Linux isn’t a real-time OS (RTOS), real-time variants or patches, like PREEMPT-RT, can provide real-time behavior for tasks like handling time-critical operations.

Wide Hardware Support: Linux has broad support for different hardware architectures, including ARM, MIPS, x86, and others, making it a flexible choice for many embedded systems.

Open-Source: Embedded Linux is based on open-source software, which provides cost-effective development without licensing fees and access to a large community for support.

Popular Tools and Frameworks:

Yocto Project: A set of tools to create custom Linux distributions for embedded systems.
Buildroot: A simpler toolset for building embedded Linux systems from scratch.
Embedded Linux is commonly used in industries like automotive, medical, industrial, and consumer electronics due to its flexibility and scalability.
